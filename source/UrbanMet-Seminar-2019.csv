Urban trees is one of the key factors; yet, systematic research is sparse, especially at the micro-γ scale (~10 m) and a clear framework for enquiry is lacking. Here we discuss a methodology for assessing reflectance and microclimatic characteristics above and below the tree canopy in the urban areas."

The WISE project is conducted about six years from year 2012 to 2017 for the research of urban weather forecasting, flash flood, road meteorology, etc. Urban meteorological observation system network(UMS-Seoul) is established in Seoul Metropolitan Area(SMA) of the South Korea capital city by the WISE project since year 2013. The network is composed of a surface energy balance observation network, a 3-D meteorological observation network such as wind lidar, microwave radiometer, aerosol lidar, ceilometer, and many sensor to measure surface temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity. The UMS-Seoul data are analyzed for the study of sea-land breeze over SMA. The data are collected in real-time at KMA and will be released to the public. It may be used for urban environment forecast, production of urban reanalysis data and renewable energy map. My talk will be general introduction to observation instruments and future plan to the application of the data at KMA."

I’ll highlight some novel aspects of the new integrated model UCLEM, and show how it responds when coupled to a GCM for climate-timescale simulations over Melbourne, Australia."

24-Jan-2019,"1L43, 4pm",,Dr. Keigo Matsuda,Building- and tree-crown-resolving large-eddy simulation for analyzing urban heat environments,"Urban high temperatures due to the combined influence of global warming and urban heat islands increase the risk of heat stroke. Greenery is one of the possible countermeasures for mitigating the heat environments since the transpiration and shading effect of trees can reduce the air temperature and the radiative heat flux. In order to formulate effective measures, it is important to estimate the influence of the greenery on the heat stroke risk. In this study, we have developed a tree-crown-resolving large-eddy simulation (LES) model that is coupled with three-dimensional radiative transfer (3DRT) model. The multiscale atmosphere-ocean coupled model, MSSG (Multi-Scale Simulator for the Geoenvironment), which is developed in JAMSTEC, is used for performing the LES. The MSSG is possible to perform multiscale simulations from the global and mesoscales to the urban scale, resolving the topography, building shapes, and tree crowns of several meters. The 3DRT model is implemented in the MSSG so that the 3DRT is calculated repeatedly during the time integration of the LES. We have confirmed that the computational time for the 3DRT model is negligibly small compared with that for the LES and the accuracy of the 3DRT model is sufficiently high to evaluate the radiative heat flux at the pedestrian level.
The present model is applied to the analysis of the heat environment in an actual urban area around the Tokyo Bay area, covering 8 km × 8 km with 5-m grid mesh, in order to confirm its feasibility. The results show that the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which is an indicator of the heat stroke risk, is predicted in sufficiently high accuracy to evaluate the influence of tree crowns on the heat environment. In addition, by comparing with a case without the greenery in the Tokyo Bay area, we have confirmed that the greenery increases the low WBGT areas in major pedestrian spaces by a factor of 3.4.
The model is further applied to the heat environment analysis in the Kumagaya Sports & Culture Park, where field observation was carried out in 2016. For the simulation, the multiscale downscaling technique is used to obtain reliable results. The finest domain covers 3 km × 3 km with 2-m grid mesh. The comparison with the field observation data confirms that the present model can predict the local difference of the wind speed, air temperature, and WBGT.
These results indicate that the present model can predict the greenery effect on the urban heat environment quantitatively."
